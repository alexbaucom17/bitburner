- Get root access for all servers available, not just ones with ram
- Improve state scanning, auto detect when I have scripts running on other servers instead of fully relying on state file
- Consider making sub-components below send command to server via ports so that server doesn't need reboot for extraneous script changes (also saves ram, maybe?)
- Improve script to identify most profitable server
- Crawl script to find all unique files out in the wild
- Make script to buy and upgrade hacknet nodes
- Make util for printing that can easily direct data to terminal when I run commands or put into log file when not
- Create a 'reset' script that cleans out stale state files after reset and also provides the steps to backdoor the various targets needed
