- Get root access for all servers available, not just ones with ram
- Improve state scanning, auto detect when I have scripts running on other servers instead of fully relying on state file
- Write crawl script to explore further than 10 deep
	- Scanlib sort of works (it at least runs), need to debug why it didn't correctly find all deeper nodes
	- Tested that hacking works on targets more than 10 away
- Consider making sub-components below send command to server via ports so that server doesn't need reboot for extraneous script changes (also saves ram, maybe?)
- Improve script to identify most profitable server
- Crawl script to find all unique files out in the wild
- Make script to buy and upgrade hacknet nodes
- Make util for printing that can easily direct data to terminal when I run commands or put into log file when not
- Set up gittea for this repo
