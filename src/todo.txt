Urgent fixes
- Add enum for switching mode of botnet (joesguns/manual/auto)
    - Fix issue of home deploy not working
    - Fix issue of mode not working

Really should do this clean up
- Make hacknet buyer upgrade existing nodes before buying more.
    - Need to handle not having max money
- Make util for printing that can easily direct data to terminal when I run commands or put into log file when not
- Figure out how to make scanning work better without having to reserve a bunch of ram on every machine
- Update scanned/hostnames to save in memory instead of via file (or force update file after initial server purchase)

Longer term ideas
- Consider wrapping bot handling in a class that can manage script running lifetime/scp/state etc
- Crawl script to find all unique files out in the wild
    - Work on coding contracts
- Improve script to identify most profitable server
    - Use more info like grow/weak time and expected change
    - Update botnet to have better scheduler that can target multiple servers at the same time
    - Update scheduler to avoid running redundant commands on multiple bots (e.g. weaken on 2 bots with same target when 1 would get all the change needed)


Brainstorming ideas after having been away for a while
- I remember managing state of the net was tricky
    - maybe have each bot drop a file on its machine with the current state
    - Update this semi regularly and then it can be used to restart the bot in the same state if needed
    - Can also be read by control machine to get status or at least have enough info to query for status
    - Missing state file can mean the bot isn't active or is in a bad state, server can reboot the bot freely
- Having a bot handling class that manages all this info on the server side seems good, but probably can start simpler than I was previously aiming
- Regular scans and crawls were also tricky if I remember correctly, will need to think more about this
- Use json serialization (example: https://dev.to/hansott/simple-way-to-serialize-objects-to-json-in-typescript-27f5) instead of custom string serialization

- [Done] Short term goal: get v2 able to bootstrap local net (non-recursive) and run static hack via Bot class
- Medium term goal: use v2 bot class scan/hack functions to iteratively build out network
- After that, can start thinking about adding more fancy features and hopefully cleaning up old code
