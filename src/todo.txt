Urgent fixes
- Add enum for switching mode of botnet (joesguns/manual/auto)
    - Fix issue of home deploy not working
    - Fix issue of mode not working

Really should do this clean up
- Make hacknet buyer upgrade existing nodes before buying more.
    - Need to handle not having max money
- Make util for printing that can easily direct data to terminal when I run commands or put into log file when not
- Figure out how to make scanning work better without having to reserve a bunch of ram on every machine
- Update scanned/hostnames to save in memory instead of via file (or force update file after initial server purchase)

Longer term ideas
- Consider wrapping bot handling in a class that can manage script running lifetime/scp/state etc
- Crawl script to find all unique files out in the wild
    - Work on coding contracts
- Improve script to identify most profitable server
    - Use more info like grow/weak time and expected change
    - Update botnet to have better scheduler that can target multiple servers at the same time
    - Update scheduler to avoid running redundant commands on multiple bots (e.g. weaken on 2 bots with same target when 1 would get all the change needed)
